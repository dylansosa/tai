CodonR is simply a set of R functions and two perl scripts for the 
analysis of codon usage in DNA coding sequences. It is distributed
WITHOUT WARRANTY under the terms of the GNU General Public
License. See the file LICENSE for details.

You should have received the following files with this package:

'tAI.R'
'codonM'
'codonZ'
'ecolik12.ffn'
'ecolik12.trna'
'LICENSE'
'README'

'tAI.R' contains a set of R functions for calculating the tRNA
adaptation index (tAI), and other auxiliary functions. It was tested with R
version 1.8.1. Go to www.r-project.org to obtain more information
about the R package for statistical computing, how to download, use
and install it.

'codonM' is a perl script that computes raw codon usage
frequencies. The output of this program is needed in order to
calculate tAI. The script was tested with perl v5.8.1

'codonZ' this is a small perl script designed to make invoking codonW
a more pleasant experience. You need codonW installed in order to use
this file.

'ecolik12.ffn' is an arbitrary set of Escherichia coli K-12 coding
sequences in FastA format. It is provided in order to test the
program.

'ecolik12.trna' E. coli K-12 tRNA gene table.

'LICENSE' the GNU General Public License.

'README' this file (obviously!).

There is no documentation provided, however, the quick tutorial (see
bellow), should give you all the necessary information to get you started
using the package.



INSTALLATION
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Just uncompress the package in a directory of your choice. The
programs were written and tested in GNU/Linux although they should work
in other operating systems that can run R and perl.



OTHER (PERHAPS) USEFUL INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This package is basically the same I used in my paper on tAI (see
references), with just a few minor modifications to make it a little
friendlier. If you have any doubts, questions, bug reports,
etc. please contact the author at:

QUICK TUTORIAL
----------------------------------------------------------------------

You are assumed to know how to use a shell or command prompt, as well as
some basic knowledge of R. $ denotes the shell prompt (so don't type
it in!).

The tRNA adaptation index (tAI) measures the degree of co-adaptation
between a coding sequence and the tRNA pool of an organism[1,2]. File
'ecolik12.ffn' contains 49 coding sequences extracted from the genome
of Escherichia coli K-12. We can use the files in the package to
calculate tAI for each one of the genes contained in this file. First we
need to calculate the frequencies of the 61 coding codons for every
sequence. Go to the directory where you saved this package files and
type (note that perl must be in your path, and installed in your
system):

$ perl codonM ecolik12.ffn ecolik12.m

The file 'ecolik12.m' contains the output of the codonM script: a
matrix of codon frequencies per ORF. It should look like:

11	19	10	13	11	10	6	9	...
6	4	3	6	0	6	1	3	...
13	11	5	12	0	2	3	5	...
0	0	2	0	1	1	1	0	...
8	8	2	6	0	4	2	1	...
...

Each row represents one ORF or gene (in our case, there should be 49
rows in the file 'ecolik12.m'), and the columns represent each one of
the 61 coding codons, arranged in this fashion:

column  codon
-------------
1	TTT
2	TTC
3	TTA
4	TTG
5	TCT
6	TCC
7	TCA
8	TCG
9	TAT
10	TAC
11	TGT
12	TGC
13	TGG
14	CTT
15	CTC
16	CTA
17	CTG
18	CCT
19	CCC
20	CCA
21	CCG
22	CAT
23	CAC
24	CAA
25	CAG
26	CGT
27	CGC
28	CGA
29	CGG
30	ATT
31	ATC
32	ATA
33	ATG
34	ACT
35	ACC
36	ACA
37	ACG
38	AAT
39	AAC
40	AAA
41	AAG
42	AGT
43	AGC
44	AGA
45	AGG
46	GTT
47	GTC
48	GTA
49	GTG
50	GCT
51	GCC
52	GCA
53	GCG
54	GAT
55	GAC
56	GAA
57	GAG
58	GGT
59	GGC
60	GGA
61	GGG

Notice that STOP codons have been excluded. codonM, also ignores the
first codon in every sequence, this is because it is always a
Methionine codon (even if its not coded by the canonical ATG).

Now start R in the same directory you have been working. (> indicates
the R prompt). Type:

> source("tAI.R")

This will load the necessary functions into R. The file
'ecolik12.trna' contains the gene copy number of every tRNA species in
the E. coli K-12 genome. We need this information in order to
calculate tAI:

> eco.trna <- scan("ecolik12.trna")

This file contains 64 columns, corresponding the codons recognised by
each tRNA species. No we can calculate the relative adaptiveness
values for each codon for the E. coli genome:

> eco.ws <- get.ws(tRNA=eco.trna, sking=1)

Now, lets retrieve the output of codonM:

> eco.m <-
  matrix(scan("/home/dycotiles/code/projects/codonR/ecolik12.m"),
  ncol=61, byrow=T)

We will ignore Methionine codons in our analysis (there is no
automatic way to differentiate between 'START' Met-tRNA genes and
normal Met-tRNAs in any genome):

> eco.m <- eco.m[,-33]

And now we an finally calculate tAI:

> eco.tai <- get.tai(eco.m, eco.ws)
> hist(eco.tai)

The last command will plot an histogram of the tAI values. Highly
expressed genes present high tAI values (> 0.4), which means that
their codon usage resembles the genomic structure of tRNA genes.

Now a good question arises, how much of the total codon usage of this
genes (in terms of Nc) is due to adaptation to the tRNA gene pool? In
order to answer this question, we need to calculate Nc for every
sequence in 'ecolik12.ffn'. You should have codonW (or other codon usage
package able to calculate Nc) installed. If you do have codonW, and it
is in your path, you can use codonZ to quickly and efficiently compute
a set of codon usage statistics. At the shell type:

$ codonZ ecolik12.ffn ecolik12.w

Now from the R prompt:

> df <- read.table("ecolik12.w", header=T)

If you are using the codonW version distributed by me, the above
command should work fine, if you are working with the original
distribution, you should type instead:

> df <- read.table("ecolik12.w", header=T, na.strings = "*****")

Lets plot the relationship between tAI and Nc:

> plot(eco.tai ~ df$Nc)

As you can see, genes with very low Nc values (highly biased),
correlate with high tAI values (highly co-adapted to the tRNA gene
pool).

> cor(eco.tai, df$Nc, use="p")

You should get a value of -0.9100338

Formally, we can calculate the correlation between tAI, and the
corrected Nc [Nc - f(GC3s)], we call this correlation S, because it
reflects the intensity of translational selection acting on our sample
of genes:

> eco.s <- get.s(eco.tai, df$Nc, df$GC3s)

You should get a value of 0.9065442
